# PA2J

I couldn't get the perl grader to work so I wrote my own Python script.

Run the script with `python3 script.py`.

Current score is 56/63.

The cases that don't pass happen either because of strange UTF-8 characters, or that making it pass required lexing logic that wasn't specified in the specs.
